# mountainlab_tests
Unit (and not so unit) tests for mountainlab

Ideally to be run semi-continuously on a remote testing system

The first test:

```bash
cd full_tests/simple_sort_001
./simple_sort_001.sh nogui
```

For now the test should just be that each of the commands returns successfully (with zero exit code)

TODO: modify the .sh to check that each of the commands returns successfully

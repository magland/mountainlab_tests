# You must first compile mountainlab and add mountainlab/bin to your path
# See mountainlab/README.md

# First download the raw data for this example into a new directory called raw

mkdir raw
prv-download datasets/example1/firings_true.mda.prv raw/ --server=river 
prv-download datasets/example1/waveforms.mda.prv raw/ --server=river
prv-download datasets/example1/raw.mda.prv raw/ --server=river

# By default, everything in the mountainlab/examples directory is searchable
# by the prv system (run mlconfig for more info).
# Therefore, those downloaded files (as they have the expected sha1 sums)
# may be located with the following command. Verify the download by running:

prv-locate datasets/example1/raw.mda.prv

# Now we are ready to run the processing and view the results in the GUI

kron-run ms3 example1 --_nodaemon
kron-view results ms3 example1
